<h2>Syntax in relation to Prolog</h2>
<p>Tyruba's syntax is based on Prolog's syntax but has some
differences.</p>
<ul>
  <li>lexical differences in representing name constants and variables</li>
  <li>no support for infix operators</li>
  <li>different syntax for terms.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Lexemes</h2>
<h4>Comments:</h4>
<blockquote> The conventions for comments are the same as those for
Java. Some examples of comments:
  <pre><font color="#0000ff">   // This is a single line comment<br>   /* This is a multi line<br>      comment */</font></pre>
</blockquote>
<h4>Literals</h4>
<blockquote>Lexemes for string literals and numbers are as in Java.
  <p><font color="#ff0000">Note: although string literals can contain
escape sequences like "<tt>\t</tt>" etc. These are recoginzed by the
parser but not all escape sequences are currently handled by the
language implementation. "<tt>\\</tt>" and "<tt>\"</tt>" work
correctly. Do not assume any other escape sequences work.</font></p>
  <p>Some examples:</p>
  <pre>   <b>integers: </b>1234  -1234 0x4FA0<br>   <b>floating point: </b>0.9   1234.4E6   -9.9E-10<br>   <b>string:  </b>"This is a simple string"  <br>            "You can escape \" and \\ in a string"<br>	</pre>
</blockquote>
<h4>Keywords</h4>
<pre>     These are "reserved" words in TyRuBa:<br><br>        AS          END         MODES       REALLY      UNIQUE<br>        BOUND       EXISTS      MULTI       SEMIDET<br>        DEFAULT     FINDALL     NONDET      TEST<br>        DET         IS          NOT         TYPE<br><br></pre>
<h4>Variables and (Name) Constants</h4>
<blockquote> <tt>TyRuBa</tt> variables are distinguishable from name
constants because variables start with a leading question mark.
</blockquote>
<pre>CONSTANT ::= &lt;LETTER&gt; (&lt;LETTER&gt;|"_"|"."|&lt;DIGIT&gt;)*</pre>
<blockquote> Name constants match any legal Java identifier, including
names qualified by a package name.
  <p><b>Examples</b>:</p>
  <pre>   abc_def.ghiASSD<br>   abx<br>   AB<br>   Snapshot<br>   java.lang.Object</pre>
  <p><b>note: </b>String literals and constants containing the same
characters are equivalent. I.e. constants are just represented as
string Literals. <tt>"abc"</tt> and <tt>abc</tt> are therefore equal
to one another.</p>
</blockquote>
<pre>VARIABLE ::= "?" (&lt;LETTER&gt;|&lt;DIGIT&gt;)*</pre>
<blockquote><b>Examples</b>
  <pre>   ?X<br>   ?<br>   ?List1<br>   ?List2b<br>   ?number</pre>
  <p>The variable "<tt>?</tt>" has a special purpose. It is like the
prolog variable <tt>_</tt>. Normally two occurrences of variables with
identical names in a query or rule will be treated as "equal". However,
for "<tt>?</tt>" each occurrence will be treated as a "fresh" variable.
(i.e. imagine that they are implicitly followed by distinct number <tt>?1</tt>,
  <tt>?2</tt>, etc...</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Quoted Code/Text Sequences</h4>
<blockquote> This is a mechanism built into <tt>TyRuBa</tt> to
facilitate the assembly of text, such as for example Java code, error
messages, etc...
  <p>Quoted code blocks start with a "<tt>{</tt>" and end at the first
matching "<tt>}</tt>". I.e. the number of "<tt>{</tt>" and "<tt>}</tt>"
must be balanced. Example:</p>
  <pre><font color="#0000ff">   { This is a simple quoted text block<br>   It may span multiple lines and contain<br>   matched numbers of { and } as this<br>   example shows.<br>   }</font></pre>
  <p>Quoted code blocks may also contain logic variables like this:</p>
  <pre><font color="#0000ff">   { This block contains a ?Variable and ?anotherVariable }</font></pre>
  <p>Question marks can be included by doubling them like this:</p>
  <pre><font color="#0000ff">   { Do you want to include a question mark ?? <br>     Then just repeat it twice to avoid it being<br>     treated as a ?variable<br>   }</font></pre>
  <p>Quoted code blocks are useful to assemble pieces of code (or other
text). Variables represent holes in the text where other text may be
fitted in by binding the variable. Every kind of binding has some
textual representation inside a quoted code block (which may differ
from the normal way it is printed).</p>

      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
  <p><b>Note:</b> Lists occuring inside quoted text are printed without
any separators or delimiters between elements. This is convenient in
some situations (e.g. inserting snippets of text found by <samp>FINDALL</samp>)
but not so convenient in others (e.g. when you use it to generate an
error message text, and actually want the list to appear as printed
with separators... this is a bit of a dilemma.)</p>

<h2>Grammar</h2>
<pre><b>CompilationUnit</b> ::= <br>  ( IncludeDirective<br>  | PredicateDeclaration<br>  | UserDefinedTypeDeclaration<br>  | Rule <br>  | Query<br>  ) *<br>  &lt;EOF&gt;</pre>
<h3>Directives</h3>
<pre><b>IncludeDirective</b>  ::= "#include" &lt;STRING_LITERAL&gt;</pre>
<blockquote> Any file loaded by <tt>TyRuBa</tt> may contain <tt>#include</tt>
directives. They look like
  <blockquote><samp> <font color="#0000ff">#include "a filename"</font>
    </samp></blockquote>
The filename is interpreted relative to the file (or <tt>URL</tt>) in
which the include directive is encountered. Include directives in <tt>-i</tt>
mode are not supported.
</blockquote>
<pre><b>
PredicateDeclaration</b> ::= &lt;STRING_LITERAL&gt; "::" TypeList<br>                         [ "MODES" ( ModeDeclaration )* "END" ]</pre>
<blockquote> Each <tt>SimplePredicate</tt> must be declared before use
(both in Rules and in Query). <tt>PredicateDeclaration</tt> contains
the predicate's argument types and its available mode of execution.
</blockquote>
<blockquote> For a more detailed explanation of predicate declaration,
take a look at the <a href="tyruba_tutorial.html#predicate_declaration"
 target="_blank"> <tt>TyRuBa</tt> tutorial</a>.
</blockquote>
<pre><b>
UserDefinedTypeDeclaration</b> ::= UserDefinedAtomicTypeDeclaration<br>                             | UserDefinedCompositeTypeDeclaration</pre>
<pre><b>
UserDefinedAtomicTypeDeclaration</b> ::= "TYPE" AtomicType "=" AtomicType ( "|" AtomicType )*<br>                                   | "TYPE" AtomicType "AS" AtomicType</pre>
<blockquote> <tt>AtomicType</tt> can be declared as a union of <tt>AtomicTypes</tt>.
</blockquote>
<blockquote> <font color="#0000ff"><tt>TYPE Vechicle = Car | Bicycle</tt></font>
is a declaration for <tt>AtomicType</tt> "<tt>Vehicle</tt>" which is
the union of <tt>AtomicTypes</tt> "<tt>Car</tt>" and "<tt>Bicycle</tt>".
One thing to note is that "<tt>Car</tt>" and "<tt>Bicycle</tt>" must be
declared before declaring "<tt>Vehicle</tt>".
</blockquote>
<blockquote> All <tt>AtomicTypes</tt> corresponding to any class in
the <tt>java.lang package</tt> are already declared. The way to
declare an <tt>AtomicType</tt> that does not have any subtypes is to
indicate what declared <tt>AtomicType</tt> is used to represent it.
</blockquote>
<blockquote> For example: <font color="#0000ff"><tt>TYPE Car AS String</tt></font>
declares <tt>AtomicType</tt> "<tt>Car</tt>" which is represented with
String. The type system of <tt>TyRuBa</tt> only knows a constant is of
type "<tt>Car</tt>" if there is a typecast on the constant. (More on
typecasting in description of <a href="#term">Term</a>)
</blockquote>
<pre><b>
UserDefinedCompositeTypeDeclaration</b> ::= "TYPE" CompositeType "=" CompositeType ( "|" CompositeType )*<br>                                      | "TYPE" CompositeType "AS" (TupleType | ListType)</pre>
<blockquote> Similar to defining atomic type declaration, composite
type declaration describes hierarchy between composite types. Please
see <a href="tyruba_tutorial.html#compound_term" target="_blank"><tt>TyRuBa</tt>
tutorial</a> for examples.
</blockquote>
<pre><b>
Rule</b> ::= SimplePredicate [ ":-"  Expression ] "."<br><br>SimplePredicate ::= &lt;IDENTIFIER&gt; "(" TermList ")"</pre>
<blockquote> Rules are simply parsed and inserted into the rule base.
Rules which do not have a condition (<samp>condition = the part after
":-"</samp>) are called <b>facts</b>. Facts are basically just rules
with a condition that is always true.
</blockquote>
<pre><b>
Query</b> ::= ":-" Expression "."</pre>
<blockquote> Immediately after a query has been parsed it is launched
in the current rule base. Its results are then printed on the standard
error device.
</blockquote>
<br>
<br>
<h2>Expressions</h2>
<pre><b>Expression</b>    ::= Disjunction | ModeSwitchExpression<br>Disjunction   ::= Conjunction ( ";" Conjunction )*<br>Conjunction   ::= Predicate ( "," Predicate )*</pre>
<blockquote> The meaning of conjunctions (logical "and") and
disjunctions (logical "or") are similar to Prolog; however, <tt>TyRuBa</tt>'s
mode system may decide to change the order of execution.
</blockquote>
<pre><b>
ModeSwitchExpression</b> ::= ModeCase ( "|" ModeCase )* [ "|" DefaultModeCase ]<br>ModeCase ::= "BOUND" VariableList ":" Expression<br>DefaultModeCase ::= "DEFAULT" ":" Expression</pre>
<blockquote><span style="font-weight: bold;">purpose: </span>A <tt>ModeSwitchExpression
  </tt>allows the developer to gain explicit control over the precise
implementation and execution order of expressions for a predicate,
depending on the binding modes of the variables. This is useful in
cases where an expert developer decides he can implement some predicate
more efficiently by providing varying implementations for different
modes. It is technically possible to provide mode clauses which are not
semantically equivalent, however this not a recommended use since it
likely will caus confusion about the meaning of a predicate when it is
being used (i.e. the meaning of an expression may change depending on
the execution order in the context of its use, this execution order is,
to some degree arbitrary!)<br>
  <br>
  <span style="font-weight: bold;">execution semantics: </span>When a <tt>ModeSwitchExpression</tt>
is evaluated, <tt>TyRuBa</tt> looks at each <tt>ModeCase</tt> in
order. If the variables in the current <tt>ModeCase</tt>'s <tt>VariableList</tt>
is not all bound, then <tt>TyRuBa</tt> moves on to the next <tt>ModeCase</tt>.
The <tt>DefaultModeCase</tt> is just a <tt>ModeCase</tt> that does
not require any variable to be bound (i.e. this <tt>ModeCase</tt> can
always be satisfied). If all the <tt>ModeCases</tt> fail and there is
no <tt>DefaultModeCase</tt>, then <tt>TyRuBa</tt> is unable to
evaluate this <tt>ModeSwitchExpression</tt> and a <tt>Mode Error</tt>
is thrown. Otherwise, the <tt>Expression</tt> corresponding to the
first <tt>ModeCase</tt> that can be satisifed is evaluated in the
exact order in which it was typed.<br>
  <br>
  <span style="font-weight: bold;">note: </span>The execution
semantics as described above does not actually occur litterally because
mode cases are resolved statically during type and mode checking, by
the mode checker. <br>

<pre><b>
ExistsQuantifier</b> ::= "EXISTS" VariableList ":" Expression</pre>
<blockquote> This expression succeeds when the enclosed expression
returns a solution. This is used mainly inside <tt>NotFilter</tt> to
ensure the Variables in <tt>VariableList</tt> are all bound.
</blockquote>
<pre><b>
FindAll</b> ::= "FINDALL" "(" Predicate "," t1=Term "," t2=Term ")"</pre>
<blockquote> Very much like Prolog's <tt>findall</tt>. The predicate
is evaluated. Then, <tt>t1</tt> is instantiated with the returned
bindings. This is done for each individual solution of the predicate
and a list is constructed with all the resulting instantiations of <tt>t1</tt>.
This list is then unified with <tt>t2</tt>.
</blockquote>
<pre><b>
ConvertToTypeExpression</b> ::= "convertTo<i>Type</i>" "(" from=Term "," to=Term")"</pre>
<blockquote> This expression succeeds if <tt>from</tt> is of type <tt><i>Type</i></tt>
and the type of <tt>to</tt> has an intersection with <tt><i>Type</i></tt>.
This is used mainly to convert from a non strict type to a <b>strict</b>
type. (More on <a href="#strict">strict type</a> later. See also the<a
 href="tyruba_library.html"> example in the library</a> specification.<br>
</blockquote>
<pre><b>
NotFilter</b> ::= "NOT" "(" Expression ")"</pre>
<blockquote> Only succeeds when Expression fails. Note all FREE
variables in the <tt>NOT</tt> must become bound before the <tt>NOT</tt>
is evaluated. The mode system may rearrange to make it so. Below are
some examples:
  <blockquote><samp> <font color="#0000ff">:- NOT(foo(?x))</font> //
illegal - ?x is not bound inside NOT<br>
    <font color="#0000ff">:- NOT(foo(?))</font> // legal<br>
    <font color="#0000ff">:- NOT(EXISTS ?x : foo(?x), bar(?x))</font>
// legal </samp></blockquote>
</blockquote>
<pre><b>
PredicateExpression</b> ::= &lt;IDENTIFIER&gt; "(" TermList ")"</pre>
<blockquote> A <tt>PredicateExpression</tt> is an "atomic"
predicate/goal to be matched with the rule base.
</blockquote>
<pre><b>
TestFilter</b> ::= "TEST" "(" Expression ")"</pre>
<blockquote> Only succeeds when Expression succeeds. This is the same
as evaluating Expression, except that bindings made while evaluating
Expression will not be retained after the <samp>TEST </samp>
expression. This expression effectively is equivalent to <samp>NOT(NOT(...))</samp>
</blockquote>
<pre><b>
UniqueQuantifier</b> ::= "UNIQUE" VariableList Expression</pre>
<blockquote> This expression succeeds when the enclosed expression
returns exactly one solution for the variables in <tt>VariableList</tt>,
and fails otherwise. Note that <tt>TyRuBa</tt> automatically removes
duplicates from any query's solutions. This means that replicated
solutions will only be counted once.

CompoundTerm</b> ::= name = &lt;IDENTIFIER&gt; "&lt;" TermList "&gt;"<br>               | name = &lt;IDENTIFIER&gt; List<br><br>TermList ::= Term [ "," TermList ]</pre>
<blockquote> Every compound term has a corresponding composite type

be declared before any reference to it. For an example of using
compound terms, please see <a href="tyruba_tutorial.html#compound_term"

<blockquote> Integers, strings and floating point constants use the
same syntax as Java's. Name constants are equivalent to strings, but it
is convenient in the notation to be able to omit the quotes around
them.

        <a name="strict"> <li> <tt>pred2</tt> uses a <b><i>strict</i></b>
type, meaning no supertype of <tt>Integer</tt> is allowed to be passed

        <li> <tt>pred3</tt> does not use a strict type; therefore, if <tt>?x</tt>
is bound to a value of type <tt>Object</tt> (a supertype of <tt>Integer</tt>),
          <tt>pred3</tt> would execute with no problem, but <tt>TyRuBa</tt>'s
type system would complain about <tt>?x</tt> having an incompatible
type from the declared type of <tt>pred2</tt> if you try to use <tt>pred2</tt>
with <tt>?x</tt> being bound to a value with type <tt>Object</tt> </li>
        <li> given type <tt>A</tt>, <tt>=A(strict)</tt>, <tt>B</tt>,

predicate that requires a strict type. For example if <tt>?x</tt> is
bound to type <tt>Object</tt>: <tt><font color="#0000ff">convertToInteger(?xInt,?x),
pred2(?xInt)</font></tt> will return the result of <tt>pred2(?x)</tt>

        <li> the <tt>REALLY</tt> in the mode declaration tells <tt>TyRuBa</tt>
that the declared mode is correct even if the system infers that it
should return more result; the following illustrate why this would
occur:
          <ul>
            <li> insert fact <tt> <font color="#0000ff">list_ref(0,[?x|?],?x).</font></tt>

            <li> then insert rule <samp><font color="#0000ff">
list_ref(?i,[?x|?r],?el) :- greater(?i,0), sum(?ii,1,?i),
list_ref(?ii,?r,?el). </font></samp> </li>
            <li> logically, we know that the fact and the rule cannot
be satisfied together, since the fact requires the first argument to be
              <tt>0</tt> and the rule requires the first argument to be
greater than <tt>0</tt>; however, the type system only remembers that
the first argument is of type <tt>=Integer</tt> in both the fact and
the rule, and it will infer that there can be more than one result
returned from using <tt>list_ref</tt> with the first two arguments
bound to integers. </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li> warning: <tt>TyRuBa</tt> will use mode information to
optimize execution, but if mode is incorrectly declared and the actual
number of results is greater than the declared mode, than <tt>TyRuBa</tt>
will throw away the "extra" results and queries with the predicate
would return incorrect result </li>
      </ul>
    </li>

<h2><a name="strict">Experimental Features</a></h2>
<h3><a name="strict">Infinite Loop Detection</a></h3>
<p><a name="strict"><tt>TyRuBa</tt> has a caching mechanism that
remembers query results of
previously run queries. This speeds up things considerably. One of
the more interesting aspects of this mechanisms is that it actually
"remembers" a lazily computed result. This means that it "remembers"
the query even before it has been computed. This allows queries which
run into their own tails so to speak to be resolved in a more
meaningful way than just looping infinitely. <tt>TyRuBa</tt> is
relatively
smart in trying other alternatives to find solutions and then later
try a previously "blocked" path again. This mechanism is quite
similar to "tabling" as in XSB. Here is a concrete example of what it
can do that prolog cannot:</a></p>
<pre><a name="strict">   <font color="#0000ff">married :: String, String<br>   MODES <br>      (F,F) IS NONDET <br>   END<br><br>   married(John,Mary).<br>   married(?x,?y) :- married(?y,?x).<br>   :- married(?a,?b).</font>

Produces the following result:

   <font
 color="#ff0000">##QUERY : married&lt;?a,?b&gt;<br>   .H########<br>   | ?b=Mary ?a=John |<br>   | ?b=John ?a=Mary |################<br>   ##END QUERY</font></a></pre>
<pre><a name="strict">In Prolog such a thing would go into an infinite loop trying the<br>married(?x,?y) rule:<font
 color="#0000ff">

   married(?x,?y) :- married(?y,?x) :- married(?x,?y) :- ...</font></a></pre>
<p><a name="strict">In <tt>TyRuBa</tt> this kind of situation is
handled better due to a
combination of the detection of queries "biting their own tail" and
not keeping to accumulate duplicate results (this makes the search
terminate when all swappings of marriage partners have been
generated).</a></p>
<p><a name="strict">I have found this a useful feature (as have many
other logic
language implementers before me with tabling and other similar
techniques), but in practice I tend to avoid the situation of really
needing it and relying on it because:</a></p>
<ol>
  <a name="strict"> <li> It clearly slows down the logic program<b>. </b>A
rewrite somehow avoiding the situation is usually much better. (This is
not necesarily a problem with the technique, but with the
implementation in <tt>TyRuBa</tt>). </li>
  <li> It is not always intuitive to know when it will and will not
have the desired effect. Infinite loops may unexpectedly appear "out of
the blue" anyway (depending on which variables are bound etc.) <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">note: </span>this problem has been
significanlty reduced by the mode system whose purpose it is exactly to
avoid the situation where queries logically producing infinite number
of results are avoided. Thus, the mode/type system makes the tabling
feature a lot more useful and dependable!)&nbsp; </li>
  </a>
</ol>
<p><a name="strict">The "#" character in the output is an indication of
the loop
detection mechanism backtracking over a "tail-biting" query.</a></p>
<h3><a name="strict">TyNI: TyRuBa Native Interface</a></h3>
<p><a name="strict">This option is no longer available; however there
is another
way to declare predicates that interact with Java code. It is still
quite experimental but if you would like more information on it,
email me at <tt>kdvolder@cs.ubc.ca</tt></a></p>
